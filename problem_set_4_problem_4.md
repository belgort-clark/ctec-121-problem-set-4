# Problem Set 4 - Problem No. 4

## Details

Be sure to include the following in your solution:

1. At the top of your code, include a section of comments that identifies all of the inputs, processes, and outputs for the program.
2. Include comments within your code explaining what the code is doing. You don't need to comment every line.
3. Code from the internet will not be accepted. A grade of **zero** for the problem will be assigned if the code that is not yours was used.
4. Use only the concepts learned during the first 3 weeks of this class and not any others you may have found on the internet.
5. I have provided some hints for each problem to help you out.

## Problem Statement

A painting company has determined that for every 112 square feet of wall space, one gallon of paint and eight hours of labor will be required. The company charges \$35.00 per hour for labor. Write a program that asks the user to enter the square feet of wall space to be painted and the price of the paint per gallon.

The program must display the following data:

- The number of gallons of paint required
- The hours of labor required
- The cost of the paint per gallon
- the labor charges
- The total cost of the paint job

Place your code in a function named **paint_calculator()**
