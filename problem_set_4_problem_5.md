# Problem Set 4 - Problem No. 5

## Details

Be sure to include the following in your solution:

1. At the top of your code, include a section of comments that identifies all of the inputs, processes, and outputs for the program.
2. Include comments within your code explaining what the code is doing. You don't need to comment every line.
3. Code from the internet will not be accepted. A grade of **zero** for the problem will be assigned if the code that is not yours was used.
4. Use only the concepts learned during the first 3 weeks of this class and not any others you may have found on the internet.
5. I have provided some hints for each problem to help you out.

## Problem Statement

A retail company must file a monthly sales tax report listing the total sales for the month and the amount of state and county sales tax collected. The state sales tax rate is 5 percent and the county sales tax rate is 2.5 percent.

Write a program that asks the user to enter the total sales for the month. From this figure, the application must calculate and display the following:

- The amount of county sales tax
- The amount of state sales tax
- The total sales tax (county plus state)

Create a function that contains your code. Name it whatever you want to.

## Hint for Problem 5

Same hints as problems 3 and 4.
