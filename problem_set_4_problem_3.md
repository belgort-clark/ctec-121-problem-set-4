# Problem Set 4 - Problem No. 3

## Details

Be sure to include the following in your solution:

1. At the top of your code, include a section of comments that identifies all of the inputs, processes, and outputs for the program.
2. Include comments within your code explaining what the code is doing. You don't need to comment every line.
3. Code from the internet will not be accepted. A grade of **zero** for the problem will be assigned if the code that is not yours was used.
4. Use only the concepts learned during the first 3 weeks of this class and not any others you may have found on the internet.
5. I have provided some hints for each problem to help you out.

## Problem Statement

Financial experts advise that property owners should insure their homes or buildings for at least 80 percent of the amount it would cost to replace the structure. Write a program that asks the user to enter the replacement cost of a building and then displays the minimum amount of insurance he or she should buy for the property.

Place your code in a function named **replacement_cost()**

## Hints for Problem 3

- This problem will require simple mathematical statements.
- No decision structures (if elif else) will be needed.
