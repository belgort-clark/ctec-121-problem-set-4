# Problem Set 4 - Problem No. 2

## Details

Be sure to include the following in your solution:

1. At the top of your code, include a section of comments that identifies all of the inputs, processes, and outputs for the program.
2. Include comments within your code explaining what the code is doing. You don't need to comment every line.
3. Code from the internet will not be accepted. A grade of **zero** for the problem will be assigned if the code that is not yours was used.
4. Use only the concepts learned during the first 3 weeks of this class and not any others you may have found on the internet.
5. I have provided some hints for each problem to help you out.

## Problem Statement

Write a program that asks the user to enter a person's age (in years). The program should display a message indicating whether the person is an infant, a child, a teenager, or an adult. Following are the guidelines:

- If the person is 1 year old or less, he or she is an infant.
- If the person is older than 1 year but younger than 13 years, he or she is a child.
- If the person is at least 13 years old, but less than 20 years old, he or she is a teenager.
- If the person is at least 20 years old, he or she is an adult.

Place your code in a function named **person_age()**

## Hints for Problem 2

- Just like Problem No. 1, you will need to use an if elif else construct.
- You will also have to check for a range of ages using a boolean operator such as and.
- You will also need other Python operators such as <, <=, > and >=.
