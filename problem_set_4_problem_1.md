# Problem Set 4 - Problem No. 1

## Details

Be sure to include the following in your solution:

1. At the top of your code, include a section of comments that identifies all of the inputs, processes, and outputs for the program.
2. Include comments within your code explaining what the code is doing. You don't need to comment every line.
3. Code from the internet will not be accepted. A grade of **zero** for the problem will be assigned if the code that is not yours was used.
4. Use only the concepts learned during the first 3 weeks of this class and not any others you may have found on the internet.
5. I have provided some hints for each problem to help you out.

## Problem Statement

Write a program that prompts a user to input a number from 1 tp 10. The program should display the Roman numeral version of that number. If the number is outside the range of numbers (1 through 10), the program should display an error message. Place your code in a function named **roman_numeral()**

The following table shows the Roman numerals for the numbers 1 through 10:

| Number | Roman Numeral |
| :----- | :------------ |
| 1      | I             |
| 2      | II            |
| 3      | III           |
| 4      | IV            |
| 5      | V             |
| 6      | VI            |
| 7      | VII           |
| 8      | VIII          |
| 9      | IX            |
| 10     | X             |

## Hints for Problem 1

- Use an if elif else to check the number entered by the user to make sure it is within the expected range of numbers (1-10).
- For checking to see which Roman Numeral it is, you will have one long series of if elif's followed by an else.
- In each of the elif's print out the Roman Numeral.
